abstract: Recent presidential elections in the US and Austria as well as the
  referendum on Brexit in the UK delivered victories or near-victories for
  populist right-wing candidates or agendas. In all three cases, globalisation
  and European integration were blamed for higher immigration and pressure on
  public services, deindustrialisation and job losses, and the attack on
  traditional values by cosmopolitan elites supported by traditional centre
  parties that have been unable or unwilling to control those processes. While
  election analysts seek to explain voting behaviour with socio-demographic
  characteristics of individuals, individual voting preferences also depend on
  the geographical context in which decisions are made. This article thus
  examines how long-term, regional structural economic changes, the varying
  impact of the Great Recession on the rise of and recovery from regional
  unemployment and current regional economic conditions, such as unemployment
  and welfare benefit losses, affect regional vote shares. In addition to those
  economic conditions, we examine the impact of immigration and urban size on
  populist vote shares. We show that regions with low, but rising immigrant
  shares, old industrial regions, smaller regions, those whose labour markets
  were exposed more and recovered less from the Great Recession, and those with
  high unemployment rates and benefit losses exhibited higher populist vote
  shares. These results are largely consistent across the three case study
  countries.
